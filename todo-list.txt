
- adjust mock repository +++
- regroup and rename all files +++
- make this thing "the widget should have a heading" +++
- pass  repository into, like dependency injection (is it wiget our end up goal?) +++
- make UI at least little better on event description page
- change repository. it should be methods that return shallow events. 
  And another method that reto–≥n detailed description.
- make this thing "data and time should be displayed as friendly name". 
  Is it only in the list? If not, maybe we need another component.

- send first version and do some consultation

-  (is it wiget our end up goal?)
- should it be different pages? because I feel like it should be popup,
  and then we pass event descriptions through the props
- make all datetimes have distinct view
- event description scrollbar
- download event button (convert to .ICS)
